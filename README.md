## Descriptions/Objectives

We aim to create an apartment renting website. That is, provide a space for landlords to put up listings for their apartments which tenants can peruse through, in order to find an apartment that suits their needs. The goal is to provide sufficient functionalities for both parties requirements. This includes allowing the landlords to specify all the necessary information about the apartments. Meanwhile, the renters will be able to specify their preferences and budget ranges when searching for an apartment.

There are two main categories of users on our website; landlords and tenants. The majority of apartment seekers are youths/younger adults from ages 16-35. As most people this age are not seeking to buy, but to rent, this allows us to capture more of our target audience. We believe this can increase the popularity of Rentr among them as they share it by talking about it with their friends, increasing our user base.

Rentr allows tenants to search for listings with specified criteria. This allows tenants to quickly find their ideal apartment. In prioritizing convenience for our users, we will also provide the ability for tenants to ask landlords questions they have about a listing. This allows other tenants to learn more about a listing too, and helps landlords clear up miscellaneous questions tenants may have. These features help support both landlords and tenants.
